To give an AWS account the necessary permissions to create RDS instances, EC2 instances, and Lambda functions, you can create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy that grants these permissions. Here are the steps and an example policy to accomplish this:

### 1. Sign into the AWS Management Console

Login with your credentials and navigate to the IAM service.

### 2. Create a New Policy

- Go to the **Policies** section under IAM.
- Click **Create policy**.
- You can use the visual editor or the JSON tab to define the policy. The JSON approach is direct, and I'll provide you with a sample policy JSON.

### 3. Sample JSON Policy

Here's an example of a JSON policy that grants permissions to create, configure, and delete RDS instances, EC2 instances, and Lambda functions. You should review and adjust the permissions according to your specific security requirements:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "lambda:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "logs:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **"rds:\*":** Allows all RDS actions.
- **"ec2:\*":** Allows all EC2 actions.
- **"lambda:\*":** Allows all Lambda actions.
- **"Resource": "\*"** means the actions are allowed on all resources.

### 4. Attach the Policy to an IAM Role or User

- After creating the policy, go to the **Roles** or **Users** section in IAM.
- Create a new role or select an existing user/role.
- Attach the policy you just created to this role or user.
